# Phaser Parcel v2 Boilerplate

> Since [Parcel v1 is deprecated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-bundler) it is recommended to use Parcel v2

This is a starter code for building Phaser games using Parcel v2 and Javascript.

# Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run dev server

```
npm run dev
```

Run production build

```
npm run build
```
Copy the production files from ```dist``` folder to your webserver.

## Game Assets

Static files such as game assets should be placed inside ```static``` folder. Contents of ```static``` folder will be bundled along with game files and ready to be served.

## Notes
This template is based on [ourcade/phaser3-parcel-template](https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-parcel-template) which depends on [parcel v1 which is no longer maintained](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parcel-bundler).
